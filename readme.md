# Jumpy Duke website

Website for the Jumpy Duke game. 

## Description

This was primarily made for an assignment in a course on front end development, with this assignment focused on CSS. 
The goal of this assignment was to create HTML pages (or reuse them from the previous submissions) and style them with CSS. There where a number of required attributes covering the basics of css typography and design. 

A secondary purpose for this website is to be part of another school project, The Jumpy Duke Game. More on this project can be found here:
